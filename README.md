# Counter-for-mobile-service-center.

This was a group mini project, a part of my acedamics. The main aim of this project was to get familiar in using services offered by uc/OS II.
The system would give a token number to the newly arrived customer and also if a window gets free then it will display the token number of the next customer to be served.

Services used: **Mailbox and Message Queue**
